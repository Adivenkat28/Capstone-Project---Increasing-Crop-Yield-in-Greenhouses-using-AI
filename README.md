# Capstone-Project---Increasing-Crop-Yield-in-Greenhouses-using-AI
The agricultural landscape has seen a dramatic change in recent years, moving toward controlled and sustainable environments. Optimising crop yield in greenhouses using controlled environments, however, necessitates a thorough comprehension of a number of factors, such as crop responses, cultivation techniques, and environmental conditions.
